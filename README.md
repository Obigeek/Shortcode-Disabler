# Shortcode-Disabler
The Shortcode Disabler Project is a Wordpress plugin originally developed for the Obigeek website. It allows us to explain the use of shortcodes without the shortcodes actually being run. Anything placed within this shortcode will be output as is, and will not be processed.

## Example

```
[dis_short] CONTENT [/dis_short]
```
```
[disable_shortcode] CONTENT [/disable_shortcode]
```

## More Info

For more info on the project check out the official [project page][1].
